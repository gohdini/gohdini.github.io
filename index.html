        <p>Hi Hj, I hope you're doing well. I've been a little troubled over what could be happening to you at every moment, if things are bad I hope they get better I really do. It pains me to think of what may be going on with you. It kind of pisses me off. You got this Hj. Although it hasn't been that long since then, I couldn't help myself and have begun creating an alternative way to communicate. So you can experience that complete secrecy and privacy you so much deserve. I hope we can continue our relationship like before, better and refreshed. I'm not giving up because I really love you Hj, although I may not have the rizz or aura just know that behind that mask of cringe is genuine love for you. The last day I've been thinking about what this could mean, this sinking sensation in my stomach. I've come close to crying but I just can't accept it, I will not give up. There's a part of me though that fears that me persisting will be the reason for your continued suffering. Hj, if that's so please tell me. If it comes down to that I will back off for good. I would be more hurt if I would continue this blindly and hurt you worse than the crap you're in now.</p>
        <p>If I prepare right, which I will. You will get an invite to a club to a classroom hosted by William Kang, a graduated applied mathematics student that is helping with the digital SAT. If your grandparents ask who this person is, say you found him from TikTok or something and apparently some of the information would just be a simple help. I'm not sure where to go from there but I will find a way we can communicate effectively in the decoy Google Classroom filled with decoy documents that could be used to store chat messages and more. This will come to you likely through other people because I'm not sure how to communicate with you anymore without putting you into a deeper and deeper trench. If you would like to respond to me, relink the link to the reading of December 5th in that document with your own message, I created a GitHub page and simply put in my message. After some time I will delete it to remove traces though, let's say every three or four days. Expect the instructions to be hidden in a series of walls, the keyword you should look for is June or the 5th. Also, you will likely find something in the math section on page 5.</p>
        <p>If you are in fact reading this I am overjoyed, hopefully you are too. If you can't relink the website, ask someone else to message Eugene or Hyunjoon the single number “1.” They will let me know and I'll know then that you are reading this. If this is too secretive I can tone it down but I'm starting here just to be as cautious as possible.</p>
        <p>So yeah, expect something coming your way in the next couple of days. I'm writing this on 12/13, 3 in the morning, so I'm going to Vietnam. I can't wait to talk with you again. Both in fear of the worst and overjoyed to be able to do that once again.</p>
        <p>I love you Hj, nothing will change that. No matter what crap happens or anything I am pretty unconditionally inclined to you. I pray that everything will work out for you Hj, until another time.</p>
