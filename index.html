        <p>Hi Hj, I hope you're doing well. I've been a little troubled over what could be happening to you at every moment, if things are bad I hope they get better I really do. It pains me to think of what may be going on with you. It kind of pisses me off. You got this Hj. Although it hasn't been that long since then, I couldn't help myself and have begun creating an alternative way to communicate. So you can experience that complete secrecy and privacy you so much deserve. I hope we can continue our relationship like before, better and refreshed. I'm not giving up because I really love you Hj, although I may not have the rizz or aura just know that behind that mask of cringe is genuine love for you. The last day I've been thinking about what this could mean, this sinking sensation in my stomach. I've come close to crying but I just can't accept it, I will not give up. There's a part of me though that fears that me persisting will be the reason for your continued suffering. Hj, if that's so please tell me. If it comes down to that I will back off for good. As much as it will hurt.</p>
